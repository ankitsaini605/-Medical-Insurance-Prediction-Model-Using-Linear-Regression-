# 🩺 Medical Insurance Prediction Model  

An end‑to‑end **Machine Learning project** designed to predict annual medical insurance costs based on demographic and health factors.  
The system integrates **Python, Pandas, Scikit‑Learn, and Streamlit** to deliver an **interactive web application** for real‑time predictions.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- 🧹 **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaned & structured insurance dataset (age, BMI, children, smoker status, region).  
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualized correlations between health factors & insurance charges.  
- ⚡ **ML Models** – Applied Linear Regression, Random Forest & XGBoost for prediction.  
- 🌐 **Web App** – Built with Streamlit for user‑friendly cost estimation.  
- 🎯 **Business Impact** – Helps individuals & insurers estimate costs and plan better.

## 📈 Key Insights  
- **Smoker status** & **BMI** are the strongest predictors of insurance cost.  
- Regional differences exist but have moderate impact compared to lifestyle factors.  
- Ensemble models (Random Forest, XGBoost) outperform baseline regression.

## 🏆 Outcomes  
✔️ Built a scalable ML pipeline for insurance prediction  
✔️ Delivered an interactive app for real‑time cost estimation  
✔️ Demonstrated strong link between health metrics & financial planning
